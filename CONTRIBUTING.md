Thank you for contributing to RTOUCH!

Guidelines:
- Open an issue to discuss major changes before implementing.
- Keep commits small and focused; use feature branches.
- Run `npm run builder` locally to verify builds before creating a PR.
- Add tests where appropriate.

Code style:
- Follow the existing project conventions (Tailwind + CRA + Node/Express).

Security:
- Do not commit secrets. Use `secrets.yaml` or Home Assistant Supervisor for runtime secrets.
